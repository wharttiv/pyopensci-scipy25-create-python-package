This workshop is developed for the [pyOpenSci in-person packaging workshop at the 
SciPy meeting in Tacoma, Washington 2025](https://cfp.scipy.org/scipy2025/talk/Z3VBWR/).

## Getting started
Before the workshop, be sure that you read our setup instructions on our [events 
page here](https://www.pyopensci.org/events/pyopensci-scipy25-create-python-package-workshop.html). 

You will need a GitHub and a testPyPi account to follow along. 

## GitHub Codespaces

We have GitHub Codespaces configured for this workshop. To be successful during 
the workshop, we suggest that you fork and open a codespace prior to attending
the workshop to ensure the enviornment loads properly. The initial codespace build can take up to 15 minutes. 

The link above provides you with instructions 
one how to do this and how to setup the accounts you need for the workshop.

## Creating your package

To use the copier template, follow the [tutorial here](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/tutorials/create-python-package.html) that walks you through the steps.
The command to run the copier template is:

`copier copy gh:pyopensci/pyos-package-template .`
